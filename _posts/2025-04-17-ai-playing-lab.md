# AI-Playing Lab – A Community for Scientist-Parents Exploring ways to PLAY with AI for our kids!

I’m honored to lead AI-Playing Lab, a networking group of scientist-parents supported by the Korea Institute of Human Resources Development in Science and Technology (KIRD).  
Together, we’re on a mission to explore creative ways to PLAY with AI for our kids.

I’m excited to learn, share, and connect with fellow scientist-parents.

## What We’re About

- Ever wondered how we can turn the flood of new AI technologies into fun, meaningful play for our children?

- What if we, as curious and creative parents, invented and shared our own AI-powered play ideas?
By collaborating, we believe we can create play experiences that our kids truly love.

- We’re building a caring community of tech-savvy parents who are passionate about AI and committed to their children’s growth and joy.

- Through hands-on exploration of various AI tools and services, we’re creating and sharing original AI play ideas—and capturing the joy our kids experience through them. Together, we’re growing as both innovators and a supportive family-focused community.

- We host regular gatherings where children are welcome!  
We also organize flexible, family-friendly meetups throughout the year so everyone can join in at their own pace.
