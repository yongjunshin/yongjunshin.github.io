# 🧠 AI-Playing Lab – A Community for Scientist-Parents Exploring AI for ways to PLAY with AI for our kids!

I’m honored to lead **AI-Playing Lab**, a networking group of scientist-parents supported by the **Korea Institute of Human Resources Development in Science and Technology (KIRD)**.  
Together, we’re on a mission to **explore creative ways to PLAY with AI for our kids**.

I’m excited to learn, share, and connect with fellow scientist-parents.

## 🌟 What We’re About

✔️ **Ever wondered how we can turn the flood of new AI technologies into fun, meaningful play for our children?**

✔️ **What if we, as curious and creative parents, invented and shared our own AI-powered play ideas?**  
By collaborating, we believe we can create play experiences that our kids truly love.

✔️ **We’re building a caring community of tech-savvy parents** who are passionate about AI and committed to their children’s growth and joy.

✔️ **Through hands-on exploration of various AI tools and services,** we’re creating and sharing original AI play ideas—and capturing the joy our kids experience through them. Together, we’re growing as both innovators and a supportive family-focused community.

✔️ **We host regular gatherings where children are welcome!**  
We also organize flexible, family-friendly meetups throughout the year so everyone can join in at their own pace.
