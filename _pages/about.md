I'm a permanent researcher at ETRI, a government-funded research institute in South Korea. 
I received my Ph.D. in software engineering at KAIST under the guidance of Professor Doo-Hwan Bae in 2023. 
My Ph.D. research focused on data-driven environment model generation for efficient verification of cyber-physical system (CPS) software. 
My research interests include model-based software engineering, meta-modeling, statistical verification, environment and uncertainty modeling, self-adaptive systems, and CPS.
