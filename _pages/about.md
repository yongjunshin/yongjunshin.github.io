I'm a researcher of [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri), a government-funded research institute in South Korea. 

I received my Ph.D. in software engineering at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) under the guidance of Professor [Doo-Hwan Bae](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/people/view?idx=12&kind=faculty&menu=170) in 2023. 

My Ph.D. research focused on data-driven environment model generation for efficient verification of cyber-physical system (CPS) software (e.g., autonomous driving). 

My research interests includes
* model-based software engineering,
* meta-modeling,
* statistical verification,
* environment and uncertainty modeling,
* self-adaptive systems modeling, and
* CPS software validation.
